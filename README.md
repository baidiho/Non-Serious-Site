# Non Serious Site description.
This is the site where i have tried to train in coding and have fun. I hope you enjoy too. 

**Remark.** I am not designer and this is why sometimes this site ***can*** and ***look*** ugly. :sweat_smile:
## *Sites`s parts*
*Site consist of 4 topics.*
1. Animations.
2. Drag and Drop
3. A little bit about forms
4. Async and HTTP.
## *Purposes*
I had two purposes to make it. 
*First* is to practice with different technologies(such as webpack, babel, SASS etc) and API`s (such as IntersectionObserver API). 
*Second* to show that i know some basic features. 
Hope, i have handled both.
